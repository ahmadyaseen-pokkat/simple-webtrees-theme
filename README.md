# EasyTree

![Development Status](https://img.shields.io/badge/status-in%20development-yellow)

EasyTree is a streamlined webtrees theme focused on simplicity for beginners. Built by modifying the excellent [JustLight theme](https://github.com/JustCarmen/webtrees-theme-justlight) with assistance from Gemini and Claude AI, the main goal is to cut down extra features that beginners find confusing and provide a user-friendly editor.

Huge thanks to [JustCarmen](https://github.com/JustCarmen) for creating the foundation that made this project possible.

## About the Name

I originally called this theme "SimplyLight," but realized that name could be confusing for other webtrees beginners like myself—it sounded too similar to the built-in "Light" theme. By including "Tree" in the name, I hope it's clearer that EasyTree is a distinct theme for webtrees.
